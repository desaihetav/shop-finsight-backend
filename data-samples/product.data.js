  "description": "Doing well with money isn’t necessarily about what you know. It’s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.  Money—investing, personal finance, and business decisions—is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.  In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life’s most important topics.",

    "description": "It's been nearly 25 years since Robert Kiyosaki’s Rich Dad Poor Dad first made waves in the Personal Finance arena.  It has since become the #1 Personal Finance book of all time... translated into dozens of languages and sold around the world.  Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of his best friend, his rich dad — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.",

    "description": "We work hard to earn our money. But regardless of how much we earn, the money worry never goes away. Bills, rent, EMIs, medical costs, vacations, kids' education and, somewhere at the back of the head, the niggling fear of being underprepared for our own retirement.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if our money worked for us just as we work hard for it? What if we had a proven system to identify dud investment schemes? What if we could just plug seamlessly into a simple, jargon-free plan to get more value out of our money for tomorrow, and have a super good life today as well?  India's most trusted name in personal finance, Monika Halan offers you a feet-on-the-ground system to build financial security. Not a get-rich-quick guide, this book provides you a smarter way to live your dream life, rather than stay worried about the 'right' investment or 'perfect' insurance. Unlike many personal finance books, Let's Talk Money is written specifically for you, keeping the Indian context in mind.",
